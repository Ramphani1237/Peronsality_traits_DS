    "Title:\n",
    "# Exploratory and Predictive Analysis of Big Five Personality Traits Using Textual Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this problem matters?\n",
    "- Personality traits play a crucial role in understanding human behavior and are widely used in psychology, recruitment, and behavioral analytics. \n",
    "- Traditional personality assessment methods rely on structured questionnaires and manual evaluation, which can be time-consuming and subjective.\n",
    "- With the growing availability of textual data such as essays, written responses, and social       content, it is important to explore whether linguistic patterns \n",
    "in text can provide meaningful insights into personality traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are we solving?\n",
    "- This project aims to analyze textual responses to identify linguistic patterns associated with the Big Five (OCEAN) personality traits and to build interpretable machine learning models for predicting these traits using classical text-based NLP techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key objectives of this project are:\n",
    "- To explore textual data and understand language usage across different personality traits.\n",
    "- To perform exploratory data analysis to uncover linguistic and statistical patterns.\n",
    "- To engineer classical text-based features such as Bag of Words and TF-IDF.\n",
    "- To train and evaluate multiple machine learning models for personality prediction.\n",
    "- To interpret model predictions and extract insights from word-level feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope of this project includes:\n",
    "- Analysis of textual data only.\n",
    "- Use of classical NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, Bag of Words, and TF-IDF.\n",
    "- Application of classical machine learning models for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of scope:\n",
    "- Deep learning models.\n",
    "- Transformer-based architectures.\n",
    "- Large Language Model (LLM) based inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project follows a structured data science workflow:\n",
    "1. Data collection and understanding\n",
    "2. Text preprocessing and cleaning\n",
    "3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "4. Feature engineering and experimentation\n",
    "5. Machine learning model training\n",
    "6. Model evaluation and error analysis\n",
    "7. Interpretability and insight extraction\n",
    "8. Conclusions, limitations, and future work\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools and technologies used in this project:\n",
    "- Python\n",
    "- Pandas, NumPy\n",
    "- Scikit-learn\n",
    "- NLTK / spaCy\n",
    "- Matplotlib, Seaborn\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, the expected outcomes include:\n",
    "- A deeper understanding of linguistic patterns associated with personality traits.\n",
    "- Comparative evaluation of classical text-based machine learning models.\n",
    "- Interpretable insights into how language reflects personality behavior.\n",
    "- A reproducible and well-documented data science pipeline.\n",
